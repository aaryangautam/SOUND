## Overview

Today, the military lacks the capabilities to simulate the electromagnetic operational environment (EMOE) that reflects the dense civilian/urban environments in military training areas. These civilian/urban environments include certain cellular, Wi-Fi, FM emergency service networks, FM radio, TV station transmissions, etc. Devices like the Stratomist are expensive and focus on emulating tactical environments. Additionally, Stratomist is limited to single-channel plain text (SC/PT) and frequency-agile (such as frequency hop) communications, which fails to completely simulate civilian/urban environments. To address such an issue, the SOUND device will enable these units to simulate EMOE without the need for dense urban environments, by providing a cost-efficient and man-portable solution to simulating a dense urban environment. 

This project will deliver a design and prototype of a Spectrum Operational Urban Noise Device (SOUND), that is capable of simulating an electromagnetic operational environment that reflects dense urban areas. Users will be able to access and reprogram the device through a GUI interface. The emitter shall be reprogrammable by EW practitioners or spectrum managers and common Soldiers, with remote control of reprogramming and operations. It shall be a one-person carry and powered by battery or shore power. Emitters shall replicate certain cellular, Wi-Fi, FM emergency service networks, FM radio, and TV station transmissions at a minimum. Other signals may be produced to accurately reflect urban environments. The emitter will identify emissions of other emitters, and tailor transmissions in order to maintain realistic spectrum congestion.
