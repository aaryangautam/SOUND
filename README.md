##Overview
Today, the military lacks the capabilities to simulate the electromagnetic operational environment (EMOE) that reflects the dense civilian/urban environments in military training areas. These civilian/urban environments include certain cellular, Wi-Fi, FM emergency service network, FM radio, TV station transmissions etc. Devices like the Stratomist are expensive and focus on emulating tactical environments. Additionally, Stratomist is limited to single-channel plain text (SC/PT) and frequency-agile (such as frequency hop) communications, which fails to completely simulate civilian/urban environments. To address such an issue, the SOUND device will enable these units to simulate EMOE without the need for dense urban environments, by providing a cost-efficient and man portable solution to simulating a dense urban environment.
